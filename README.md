# Dart Async/Await and JSON Handling: Robust Error Management

This example demonstrates a common issue in Dart:  incompletely handling potential errors when using async/await with JSON data from a network request.

The original code successfully processes a 200 OK response but does not handle:

* **Missing JSON Keys:**  The code attempts to access `item['name']` without checking if the 'name' key exists in each item of the JSON response. This can lead to runtime exceptions.
* **Network Errors:** The catch block provides minimal error handling.  Production-ready code needs more detailed logging and potentially re-throwing exceptions to allow higher-level error handling.
* **JSON Decoding Errors:**  The `jsonDecode` call might throw a FormatException if the JSON data is invalid. This isn't explicitly handled.

The improved solution addresses these shortcomings by incorporating comprehensive error checks and logging.
